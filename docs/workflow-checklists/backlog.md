## Implementation Notes

These items have been deferred based on the following considerations:

1. **Current Priority**: Focus on core functionality before optimization
2. **Resource Allocation**: Efficient use of development resources
3. **Dependency Order**: Some features require others to be completed first
4. **Usage Patterns**: Some optimizations benefit from real-world usage data
5. **Complexity Management**: Phased approach to manage implementation complexity

Each item should be evaluated for inclusion in future sprints based on:
- Business impact
- Technical debt implications
- User experience enhancement
- Operational requirements
- Resource availability
